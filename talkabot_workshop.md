# Botkit Studio Starter Kit

This repo contains everything you need to get started building a bot at the
Talkabot Workshop!

### Get Started

Clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:howdyai/botkit-studio-starter.git`

Install dependencies, including [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit):

```
cd botkit-studio-starter
npm install
```

### Tokens

Each participant in the Talkabot Workshop will have a personal development bot
waiting for them. The API token required to control this bot was included in the
workshop preparation. If you've got your own Slack team and would prefer to
build a bot inside your own team instead, you may get a token [here](https://my.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7YS25R-bots)

During the course of the workshop, you will also want to get a [Botkit Studio token](https://studio.botkit.ai).
Use the invite code provided in the workshop email to register for your developer account.
